# How JS Run in browser

The browser first downloads the javascript code then then the javascript engine parses that  
javascript code and divides it into a structured format called ATS (abstract syntax tree).  
Then the engine compiles the code into machine code using JIT comilation (just in time).  
Then the Javascript code is executed line by line within a specific execution context
